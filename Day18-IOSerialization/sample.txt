The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are acceptable. To specify these values yourself, construct an OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying platform. Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened for writing by only one FileWriter (or other file-writing object) at a time. In such situations the constructors in this class will fail if the file involved is already open.FileWriter is meant for writing streams of characters. For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileOutputStream.Since:JDK1.1See Also:OutputStreamWriter, FileOutputStreamField SummaryFields inherited from class java.io.WriterlockConstructor SummaryConstructors Constructor and DescriptionFileWriter(File file)Constructs a FileWriter object given a File object.FileWriter(File file, boolean append)Constructs a FileWriter object given a File object.FileWriter(FileDescriptor fd)Constructs a FileWriter object associated with a file descriptor.FileWriter(String fileName)Constructs a FileWriter object given a file name.FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append)Constructs a FileWriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written.Method SummaryMethods inherited from class java.io.OutputStreamWriterclose, flush, getEncoding, write, write, writeMethods inherited from class java.io.Writerappend, append, append, write, writeMethods inherited from class java.lang.Objectclone, equals, finalize, getClass, hashCode, notify, notifyAll, toString, wait, wait, waitConstructor DetailFileWriterpublic FileWriter(String fileName)           throws IOExceptionConstructs a FileWriter object given a file name.Parameters:fileName - String The system-dependent filename.Throws:IOException - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist but cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reasonFileWriterpublic FileWriter(String fileName,          boolean append)           throws IOExceptionConstructs a FileWriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written.Parameters:fileName - String The system-dependent filename.append - boolean if true, then data will be written to the end of the file rather than the beginning.Throws:IOException - if the named file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist but cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reasonFileWriterpublic FileWriter(File file)           throws IOExceptionConstructs a FileWriter object given a File object.Parameters:file - a File object to write to.Throws:IOException - if the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does not exist but cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other reasonFileWriterpublic FileWriter(File file,          boolean append)           throws IOExceptionConstructs a FileWriter object given a File object.
